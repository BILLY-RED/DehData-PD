        1. <strong>Take Initiative </strong>
        <br />
        The sense of urgency and taking the initiative of a task to directly manage and plan then delegate will help you hone your critical
        thinking and managing ability. Hence, taking the initiative in circumstances triggers your alertness and awareness to effectively
        delegate work tasks and grasp the whole situation upon effectively managing your team or work task,<br />

        <br />
        2. <strong> Problem solving</strong>
        <br />
        When you encounter a problem, what do you do? As a great manager, it is likely to go unto deep thinking with analytical and critical
        skills as the first step. Solving the problem is not just presenting the issue or analyzing the situation. Hence, it is likely to
        derive a solution to the problem. What is the problem, what are the factors triggering the problem, what are the possible solutions
        to the factors deriving the problem, and lastly <br />
        <strong>conclusion; what is the most effective way to counterattack the problem?</strong>

        3. <strong> Goal setting</strong> <br />
        <br />

        The intent of knowing the goal gives a spark of motivation. Goal setting is necessary to build your skeleton map toward the output.
        Determining a goal helps you shape your plans and action to carry out the task effectively. A goal-driven person will be persistent
        in his activity and even consistent if that certain individual is carrying a goal with time orientation.
        <br />
        Goal setting aligns with managing, organizing, and planning. <br />

        4. <strong> Seek Management Opportunity</strong>
        <br />
        Lastly, practice!! Seek out management opportunities where you can take the lead, take initiative, plan, and goal set. We all know
        that repetition is the mother of skills. So keep enhancing your managerial skills through actively participating in group activities
        and executing your managerial knowledge.
        <br />
        Managerial skills are co-aligned with planning, organizing, scheduling, goal setting, & solving problems, mastery of this field can
        make you a more efficient managerial state or effective leader in your team.
